apparently ive found that this the data column for thal isnt for thalassemia 
as what the majority of kaggle notebooks would seem to indicate

Investigating Heart Disease Datasets and Building Predictive Models
By Brandon Simmons II

Inconsistent description of dataset
(page 9)
Thallium test is first mentioned
(page 12)
They removed ca and thal and named them "Number of Major Vessels" and "Thallium Heart Rate" respectively
(page 18)
Under electrocardiogram mentions the thallium test and contextualizes the values of 0, 1, 2, to Normal, Abnormal, and Hypertrophy respectively
Also this "Thallium Stress Test" also known as "Nuclear Stress Test" or "Cardiac Test" benefits heart disease research by analyzing the condition of blood flow [14]. 
The gamma camera through nuclear imaging tracks the participant’s blood flow which carries a sample amount of Thallium isotope [14].
(page 21)
Contextualizes thal as thalassemia 
(page 33)
They mention that thal means patient heart rate
The attributes are the same as those listed in Table 2.4 i.e., those in Table 2.3 minus two columns: number of major vessels (ca) and patients heart rate (thal).

(Description of Dataset)
Thal—no explanation provided, but probably thalassemia (3 normal; 6 fixed defects; 7 reversible defects).

(dataset attributes detailed information.)
Thal, Status of the heart illustrated through three distinct numbered values. Normal numbered as 3, fixed defect as 6 and reversible defect as 7

status of heart seems to indicate the thallium test

Is consistent about the description of thal to be thallium
This can be useful with data analysis tho

Thal 
“The thallium heart scan attribute refers to the results of a thallium heart scan, 
which is a type of nuclear imaging test used to evaluate blood flow to the heart muscle.”
